### Problem Statement

With the emergence of legal sports gambling in more states across the country, there are more people than ever placing wagers on professional and collegeiate sporting events. In the current landscape, bettors have a variety of options for viewing the wagering odds being offered on an event. Many existing sportsbooks and casinos create their own applications or websites to facilitate the wagering process. There are also third-party applications and websites designed for an aggregate view of the odds being offered across multiple sportsbooks. Note for clarification, sportsbooks often do not offer the same exact odds on a particular event. Bettors have options available if they want to view the odds of upcoming events.

Some applications and websites, which were prominent prior to states being allowed to authorize sports gambling, have attempted to integrate betting odds into their applications with varying degrees of success. In some cases, the page design would not present the wagering information clearly or designs would be cluttered with ads. I would like to build an application that presents betting odds for upcoming events in a clean and simple manner.
