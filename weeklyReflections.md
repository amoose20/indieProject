# Weekly Reflections

Week 1 - Completed initial project repo setup.

Time spent: 1 hour

Week 2 - Browsed and researched available API's. Found one that was relatively interesting to me. Started to research how to use an API in an application, something I have not really done before. Developed a problem statement. Completed indie project pitch in the slack channel. Started to write user stories and identified those that are part of the Minimum Viable Product.

Time spent: 2 hours

Week 3 - I struggled to balance my time working on the exercise vs continuing to work on the indie project. The exercise took me a bit longer than I initially anticipated and I was determined to finish the exercise first before doing more work on the project. That was a bit of a mistake and I need to improve on balancing my time. Through recognizing this I believe I can correct it and set aside time each week to complete work on the project.

Adding all design documents and materials I have been working on to my project repo. I am realizing now that I should be continuously updating my reflections and project work within the actual project repo each and every week. Many of the design documents, including the reflections, I have simply been maintaining outside of the VM, just on my personal PC. I will make sure to do weekly updates to the project repo.

I was able to add a few more user stories and start making wireframes for my application screens. Used figma to develop wireframes of the screens I hope to design. For the upcoming week, I hope to start adding a user Class and begin building the database. After I complete this week's exercise and class material, including DAO and Hibernate, I hope to integrate it into my project.

Time spent: 3 hours

Week 4/Week 5 - I was able to create the User class and implement Hibernate. UserDao has been created and the methods contained with it are all tested in the UserDaoTests.

It took me some time to fully understand and complete the exercises for Weeks 4 and 5. After completing Week 5's materials, I feel I have a much better understanding of 

Hibernate and using DAO's. I have implemented the logic from Weeks 4/5 into my indieProject User class. 

I have not created a Set<> for my User or a test database yet. These two items are next on my agenda.
