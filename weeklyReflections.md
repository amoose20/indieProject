# Weekly Reflections

Week 1 - Completed initial project repo setup.

Week 2 - Browsed and reserched available API's. Found one that was relatively interesting to me. Started to research how to use an API in an application, something I have not really done before. Developed a problem statement. Completed indie project pitch in the slack channel. Started to write user stories and identified those that are part of the Minimum Viable Product.

Week 3 - I struggled to balance my time working on the exercise vs continuing to work on the indie project. The exercise took me a bit longer than I initially anticipated. Through recognizing this I believe I can correct it and set aside time each week to complete work on the project.

Week 4 - Adding all design documents and materials to my project repo. Used figma to develop wireframes.
